  mainText: 'Items can be picked up and carried over by either player, gnome, conveyor
    or splitter. For now lets pick it ourselves and place it in the rack. You can
    see that the Item bar shows you the icon, address and the code of the icon. This
    is very important as it is the core of the systems. Later, the items should show
    you level and price as well. '
