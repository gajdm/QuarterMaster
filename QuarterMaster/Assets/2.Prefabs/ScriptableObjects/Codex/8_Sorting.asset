  mainText: 'You have a very simple setup ready.This setup has the Import Portal
    (bright green), Labelling Station (dark green), Rack (bright red) and an export
    portal (dark red). The game automatically attached the required addresses to
    the rack and started the ordering process. A crate (purple) should spawn inside
    the Import portal. Then you can place the crate inside the labelling station.
    This spawns items that then have to sorted in the racks. Once a bag is full it
    spawns outside of the rack. You can take this bag to the export portal to complete
    order. '
