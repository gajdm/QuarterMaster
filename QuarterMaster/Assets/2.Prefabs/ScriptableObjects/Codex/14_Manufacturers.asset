  mainText: You can open the manufacturer menu in the upper bar. It is the first
    button on the left. Manufacturers have different levels. You can aquire more
    manufacturers later. Depending on the manufacturers level they may send you better
    gear. Try clicking on an icon of any manufacturer. In this Manufacturer Card
    you can see details of that manufacturer. Higher level items cost more and therefore
    you will be rewarded more if you complete orders with these items inside. Upgrading
    and aquiring manufacturers will cost money later.
