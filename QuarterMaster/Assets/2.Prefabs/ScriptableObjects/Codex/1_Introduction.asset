  mainText: Hello and welcome to the Vertical Slice of the game QuarterMaster. What
    you are looking at at the moment is a prototype of codex menu. This will explain
    to the player all of the systems and mechanics and how they work together. You
    can always close and open this menu with the green button on the left. To progress
    through the codex menu use the buttons at the buttom of this menu. I hope you
    enjoy your time trying this vertical slice :) .
